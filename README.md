# AnomalyDetection-Fraud
Comparison &amp; validation of Fraud Anomaly detection model using different algorithms, resampling methods.

The objective of this project is to build a Fraud detection model that can identify and flag fraudulent transactions in credit card transactions. The fraud detection model will be based on different Machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, boosting, bagging and neural nets. Building up and creating this model is challenging as the data is highly unbalanced and relying solely on the accuracy of the Evaluation of the model is not an option.

The first objective of this project is the use various machine learning models and identification of a model or combinations of models (ensemble) which can result in a good prototype for fraudulent transactions in the case of the specific data that we have used.

The second objective is to standardize this approach and identify anomalies in different Industries with different data (example, identifying anomalies in mobile transactions, breast cancer detection etc.)

The dataset for this project is at  
http://www.ulb.ac.be/di/map/adalpozz/data/creditcard.Rdata. This dataset comprises of the credit card transactions in Sep2013 by European cardholders. 

Another set of validation is done on Fraud Data from Microsoft. https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Online-Fraud-Detection-Step-5-of-5-publish-web-service-2
